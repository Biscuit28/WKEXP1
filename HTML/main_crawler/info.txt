DEPRECATED crawlers
  zxxk.py - some elements cannot be retrieved. New zxxk.py in gather
            fixes this by getting data straight from our database itself

  dearedu - tab clicking method does not get all data

  ht88 - does not work anymore for some unknown reason. trying the icnrement method

  tl100 - works well, but the website itself seems inactive.
